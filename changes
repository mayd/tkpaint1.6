TKPAINT 1.6
------------------
* Mainly added several dash line styles (under the "Line" menu)
* Warning !!! - Tkpaint 1.6 will not work under Tcl/Tk versions prior to 8.3 !!!
* Some minor bug fixes (now you can send PostScript output to GhostView
  under Windows NT).

TKPAINT 1.52
------------------
* Replaced old gifs (for toolbar buttons) with new transparent gifs.
* Fixed path problems to make tkpaint run on macintosh too.
* Some more bug fixes, mainly related to grabs on toplevel windows.
* Looks quite stable by now.

TKPAINT 1.51
------------------
* Fixed the "Zoom/No snap" bug (graphics snap size somehow increased too
  even if snap was off).
* Fixed bug related to long file names with spaces
  (like "c:/Program Files/tkpaint/...").
  This problem occured with pic files, preference files, and image files.
  Tkpaint did not open such files. Typical bug.

TKPAINT 1.5
------------------
* Zoom: 50%, 75%, 100%, 150%,... ,500%
* Img package integrated (http://home.wxs.nl/~nijtmans)
  Possible to insert images of type: JPEG, windows BMP, XPM, PNG, TIFF, and
  POSTSCRIPT. Win95/NT may have problems with POSTSCRIPT though.
* SCROLLBARS to the tkpaint canvas.
* Fixed the "lower group history bug" (to those who know what I mean :-)
* Fixed some more bugs related to the History/Undo with groups.
* Improved file saving
* When resizing a group of objects, the text is also get resized proportionally
  to the X-direction. Resizing of fonts was not present at earlier versions.

TKPAINT 1.4
------------------
* Added "reshape" feature for lines and polygons. That is, now it is possible
  to pick an existing line or polygon (including smooth ones) and to relocate
  its vertices (drag the with the mouse). In addition, you may add new vertices
  to existing polygons/lines, and you can also delete vertices.
  See the help.
* Added the "Deform group" feature. It is possible to select a group of
  objects and deform all the objects with respect to inclination.
  This is good for drawing 3d stuff.
* some more bug fixes (not much).
* Added "Prefrences" to the "File" menu". Now you can save you favourite
  parameters to a file, and even create several such files.
  You may load such files at any time during your work.
  This enhances work productivity. Read more in "HELP".
* Possible to supply one command line argumnet to tkpaint (pic file name).
  Useful for Unix shell users, or when running tkpaint from the command line
  from a DOS window.
